=================Oblique============
Oblique Fonts: In the late 19th Century, oblique styles were created by type foundries to emphasize display text. Many of these foundries started to include oblique fonts with regular styles. Many designers have argued that oblique sans serifs don't stand out as much as serif italics do.
Most sans serif fonts include oblique styles, the only exception being humanist sans serifsâ€”like the name, these fonts are based on the human style of writing. Therefore, a true italic is necessary.
